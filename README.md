# NYC Restaurants Data Visualization Project
### Objective
The primary goal of this project is to create an interactive web application that provides valuable insights into New York City's restaurant scene. Utilizing a dataset from Kayak, the application aims to offer users an intuitive way to explore various restaurant options. These options are based on different parameters such as cuisine diversity, customer reviews, and pricing tiers. This project serves as a showcase of our team's technical skills in data engineering, web development, and data visualization.

### Technical Skills Utilized
- Python: Used for data cleaning, preprocessing, and server-side logic through Flask API.
- HTML/CSS: Employed for front-end structure and styling. Custom styles were applied to map containers, chart containers, and filters to enhance the user interface.
- JavaScript: Utilized for front-end logic and interactivity. Integrated Leaflet for map visualization and Mapbox for map styling.
- SQL Database: Implemented for efficient data storage and retrieval.
- Data Visualization: Incorporated Chart.js for creating a variety of chart types, including pie charts, bar charts, polar charts, donut charts, and radar charts.

### Summary
In this collaborative effort, we developed a comprehensive web application that provides insights into restaurants in New York City. The backend was built using Python and Flask, with data stored in an SQL database. The front-end was designed using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. We also featured interactive maps via Leaflet and Mapbox. Various types of interactive charts were implemented using Chart.js to answer a set of specific research questions.
